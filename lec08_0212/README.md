## Pointers in LC3

Here is a weekend exercise since MP3 might be too simple compared to MP2:

 * What is the difference between `swap_test.asm` and `swap_working.asm` in this folder?
   - **Hint:** Compile them both, set breakpoint just before and after the `JSR` calls and go examine the Runtime stack at each point for each file. 
 * If I tell you, `swap_test.asm` is a translation of `swap_test.c`, how would you modify the C code to make it match `swap_working.asm`?
